          <h2>Introduction</h2>
                 <p><a href='https://www.hartfordpromise.org'>Hartford Promise</a> is a scholarship fund organization that helps to connect Hartford students with colleges at which they can succeed. There are a variety of different universities that students from Hartford Promise have historically attended throughout the state of Connecticut. Some of these Universities Participate in the Connecticut Automatic Admissions Program (CAAP) in which students who meet a set of basic requirements are automatically admitted to participating universities. 

                    <p>There are a variety of both public and private institutions throughout Connecticut that qualifying seniors can attend through the CAAP program:
                       <p>Central Connecticut State University (Public)
                       <p>Eastern Connecticut State University (Public)
                       <p>Southern Connecticut State University (Public)
                       <p>Western Connecticut State University (Public)
                       <p>Goodwin University (Private)
                       <p>Mitchell College (Private)
                       <p>University of Bridgeport (Private)
                       <p>University of New Haven (Private)
                       <p>University of Saint Joseph (Private)


              <p>The CAAP program is an enticing offer for Connecticut high school seniors when choosing the school that they would like to attend. Mainly, it is the accessibility granted to applying to universities around that is the benefit to the CAAP program. The high school senior would only need to meet two qualifications: being a current Connecticut high school senior who is on track to graduate and to be in the top 30% academically of their graduating class. With no need to go through extensive application processes and pay large application fees that are often individualized to each school, qualifying seniors can attend any of the nine participating universities. 

               <p>While the CAAP program allows students—especially those who come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds—to apply to college with significantly lower barriers to entry, it is how well these students do at these institutions that is of significance to organizations like Hartford Promise. One reason for this is because organizations like Hartford Promise need to know which schools are best for the youth that they are funding. This allows them to guide their scholars toward the correct direction when choosing the best school for them. By analyzing the recently updated data from Hartford Promise on the performance of their scholars in prior semesters, it is possible to dive deeper into the fact that students may be more likely to succeed at some CAAP schools over others.

          <h2>Section 2</h2>
          <p>When assessing outcomes for Hartford Promise students who attend these CAAP institutions, it is important to define what success looks like. In using the data given by Hartford Promise, success is most clearly defined when a student receives a Bachelor’s degree. This is because it shows that a student attended one (or perhaps multiple) institution in which they completed academic milestones in order to study what they are interested in. This benchmark of success was then contextualized in the number of students enrolled at any of the nine CAAP institutions. By dividing the number of Bachelor degree earners at each institution by the total number of Hartford Promise students enrolled at that institution, there was a resulting completion rate that allowed for clearer comparison between the past outcomes of the scholars at CAAP institutions. 

         <p>General finings show that the average completion rate for the nine CAAP institutions was approximately 32% overall. This was calculated by dividing the sum of Hartford Promise bachelor degree earners at all of the institutions by the sum of Hartford Promise students enrolled at any time at these institutions. Using the same method of calculation, the completion rates for public and private CAAP institutions could be compared. The average completion rate for public CAAP institutions was approximately 41% and 19% for private institutions. 

         <p>While creating pivot tables to find these numbers, it started to becomebecame clear that not all of the nine CAAP institutions would be usable to assess outcomes for Hartford Promise students. One institution, Mitchell College, did not have data for any past Hartford Promise Students attending. As such, it was not possible to calculate the completion rate at that college. In addition, other institutions like Western Connecticut State University, University of Bridgeport, and University of New Haven each had only one instance of a Hartford Promise student enrolling at any time throughout their higher education path. In addition, none of these three students went on to achieve a Bachelor’s degree at any of the three institutions. As such, the sample size from these four universities would not be significant enough to consider them for comparison. 

      <p>However, the other institutions with larger sample sizes could be compared in terms of their success rates:

            <p> <iframe title="Completion Rate Comparisons of Qualifying CAAP Institutions" aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-ZnLVl" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ZnLVl/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="718" height="484" data-external="1"></iframe>

            <p>A bar chart within a table made the most sense when visually displaying the data because it most clearly illustrates the differences in the percentages of Hartford promise students who completed a Bachelor’s degree at these particular CAAP institutions. The chart was placed within a table because it most clearly shows the raw data at these CAAP institutions; this helps to contextualize the percentages. At 39%, Southern Connecticut State University has the highest completion rate amongst these schools. On the lower end, although Goodwin University had the second highest number of enrolled Hartford Promise students (21 students), there were no instances of any student completing a Bachelor’s degree at the school. The data shows that Hartford Promise students do not stay at Goodwin University multiple semesters. 

            <p>Another important aspect of Hartford Promise students attending CAAP universities is how they compare with the other students at these schools. By using College Scorecard, it is possible to start to make these comparisons. In terms of completion rate based upon enrollment and earning a bachelor’s degree, College Scorecard does not provide the matching to completely mimic the completion rates extrapolated from the Hartford Promise. However, College Scorecard does provide a “graduation rate” of students who enrolled in a university and were able to graduate with a degree (the type of degree was not specified). By comparing the Hartford Promise completion rates to College Scorecard’s graduation rates, there are noticeable gaps between the general student body and Hartford Promise scholars. 

            <p>The comparison between these rates was done by using a range chart. This type of chart mostly clearly illustrated the gaps between the general body and Hartford Promise students at these schools:
              
             <p>  <iframe title="Hartford Promise Scholars Earn Historically Fewer Bachelor's Degrees at Most CAAP Universities than Other Students   (Copy)" aria-label="Range Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-r17F3" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/r17F3/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="347" data-external="1"></iframe>

              
             <p> The data from this range chart shows how Hartford Promise students have typically had lower completion rates than the rest of their peers at these CAAP institutions. Aside from the University of Saint Joseph, this trend remains true.

          <h2>Section 4: Advanced Tips</h2>

          <p>Change names of `Section 1` etc. to customized navigation labels that make sense for your data story, such as `Why It Matters` or `How We Made This` etc. To do this you must change names in TWO places: see the Navigation Container (around lines 30-50) and the corresponding Sections below. Keep the section numbers but change the reader-friendly labels.</p>

          <h4>Optional Subheaders: Use H4 tags to break up long sections</h4>

          <p>All of your data visualizations should be interactive. But if you need to insert a static image, you can upload a JPG or PNG to the GitHub repo, and insert it using the HTML img tag as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Figure 2: Describe your image in a caption, and always credit the source if someone else created it.</p>

          <h4>Quickly Edit and View Changes on Your Local Computer</h4>

          <p>HINT: Instead of slowly making edits on GitHub, you can quickly make edits in your local computer and view them instantly in your browser. Here's a list of steps (in HTML format):
            <ol>
              <li>Go to your GitHub repo and select Code > Download Zip and uncompress the folder.</li>
              <li>Install a free code editor tool. My fav is <a href="https://atom.io">Atom Editor</a> but there are others, too.</li>
              <li>Open the "index.html" file with your code editor and make edits.</li>
              <li>In your browser, go to File > Open to view the "index.html" file that is on your local computer.</li>
              <li>After making some edits in the "index.html" file, save it, and refresh your browser to view changes. Most edits should appear right away.</li>
              <li>After making multiple edits on your local computer, carefully copy and paste the contents of "index.html" in your online GitHub account, and test your published updates online.
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h4>Two Options for Tables</h4>

          <p>If you need to create a table, first try the Datawrapper Tables tool -- see <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/table.html'>HODV Chapter 8</a> -- and embed the results like this:</p>

          <iframe title="Table 1: Suburbs Offer a Small Percentage of Their Seats to Hartford Open Choice Students " aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-Qrb7J" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Qrb7J/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="972"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
          </script>

          <p>Table 1: Add your standalone caption here.</p>

          <p>A second option is to use the <a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables">Tables Generator HTML tool</a>. Go to File > Import or manually enter your table data, then Generate the HTML code, and paste it here, similar to this sample: </p>

          <style type="text/css">

            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">123</td>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">456</td>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">789</td>
